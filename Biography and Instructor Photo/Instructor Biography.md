## Joe Amditis

Joe Amditis is the associate director of operations at the Center for Cooperative Media at Montclair State University, where he has worked since 2015. His work focuses on newsroom technology, AI tools, and practical strategies for helping journalists and media organizations work more efficiently.

Amditis teaches and writes about the intersection of artificial intelligence and journalism. He has led workshops on prompt engineering and AI workflows for news organizations across the country, and publishes the Struggle Street newsletter (strugglestreet.substack.com) on AI in journalism practice.

This course draws directly on his daily work. He uses Claude Code, Gemini CLI, and other command-line AI tools for data analysis, document processing, and building internal newsroom tools. The curriculum reflects real workflows developed through that practice — built from problems he has actually encountered and solved.

The Center for Cooperative Media supports local journalism across New Jersey and beyond through research, training, and direct newsroom support. Amditis works at the intersection of that mission and emerging technology, helping newsrooms understand what AI tools can and can't do and how to build sustainable practices around them.

His GitHub profile (github.com/jamditis) includes open-source tools built for journalism workflows: skills libraries for Claude Code, web scraping utilities for newsroom research, and other resources referenced throughout this course.
