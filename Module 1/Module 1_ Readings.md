# Module 1: Escaping the chat window

## Required readings

### 1. The big picture: understanding the AI landscape

**"A guide to which AI to use in the agentic era"**
Ethan Mollick, One Useful Thing, February 2026
https://www.oneusefulthing.org/p/a-guide-to-which-ai-to-use-in-the

*Reading time: 15-20 minutes*

Read this first. Mollick's framework for thinking about AI has three layers: the underlying models, the apps that interface with them, and the "harnesses" that enable AI to take real-world actions. This course is fundamentally about moving from apps (ChatGPT.com, Claude.ai) to harnesses — tools that connect AI to your files, scripts, and workflows. Understanding this distinction before you install anything will help everything else in the course make sense.

Pay attention to:
- The difference between models, apps, and harnesses — and why the same model performs differently in each context
- Why "auto" mode typically underperforms manually selecting a model
- The shift from "conversing with AI" to "delegating to AI" — this is the central idea of the course

### 2. A journalist building newsroom tools without a coding background

**"Vibe coding for newsrooms"** — Joe Amditis, Generative AI in the Newsroom, December 2025
https://generative-ai-newsroom.com/vibe-coding-for-newsrooms-6848b17dac99

*Reading time: 10 minutes*

The course instructor describes building newsroom tools with Claude Code and Gemini CLI without a formal coding background. The central argument: the skills that matter for this work aren't technical — they're project management. Clear requirements, direct feedback, organized documentation. These are skills journalists already have.

Pay attention to:
- Why planning mode matters before writing any code
- How to describe what you want precisely enough for the tool to act
- The difference between "vibe coding" (managing the AI) and traditional coding (writing the code yourself)

### 3. Official documentation (pick one tool to start)

Choose the tool you plan to install and read its getting started guide:

- **Claude Code:** https://docs.anthropic.com/en/docs/claude-code
  - Anthropic's official CLI. Requires an Anthropic API key or Claude subscription.

- **Gemini CLI:** https://github.com/google-gemini/gemini-cli
  - Google's command-line interface. Free tier includes 1,000 requests per day.

- **OpenAI Codex CLI:** https://github.com/openai/codex
  - OpenAI's terminal tool. Requires ChatGPT Plus subscription.


### 4. Why the command line matters for journalists

- Simon Willison, "CLI tools are having a renaissance"
  - https://simonwillison.net/2024/Mar/22/cli-tools/
  - Explains why experienced developers are moving back to terminal-based workflows.

- Ethan Marcotte, "AI and the command line"
  - https://ethanmarcotte.com/wrote/ai-and-the-command-line/
  - Practical perspective on when terminal tools beat web interfaces.

### 5. Terminal basics (if needed)

If you are new to the command line:

- Ubuntu's "Using the terminal"
  - https://ubuntu.com/tutorials/command-line-for-beginners
  - Works for Mac and Linux users. Windows users should use Git Bash or WSL.

- The Odin Project, "Command Line Basics"
  - https://www.theodinproject.com/lessons/foundations-command-line-basics
  - Interactive tutorial covering navigation and basic commands.

## Time estimate

- Tool documentation: 15-20 minutes
- CLI renaissance articles: 20-30 minutes
- Terminal basics (if needed): 30-45 minutes
