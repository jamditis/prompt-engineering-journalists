# Module 1: Escaping the chat window

## Required readings

### 1. The big picture: understanding the AI landscape

**"A guide to which AI to use in the agentic era"**

*Reading time: 15-20 minutes*

Read this first. Mollick's framework for thinking about AI has three layers: the underlying models, the apps that interface with them, and the "harnesses" that enable AI to take real-world actions. This course is fundamentally about moving from apps (ChatGPT.com, Claude.ai) to harnesses — tools that connect AI to your files, scripts, and workflows. Understanding this distinction before you install anything will help everything else in the course make sense.

Pay attention to:
- The difference between models, apps, and harnesses — and why the same model performs differently in each context
- Why "auto" mode typically underperforms manually selecting a model
- The shift from "conversing with AI" to "delegating to AI" — this is the central idea of the course

### 2. Official documentation (pick one tool to start)

Choose the tool you plan to install and read its getting started guide:

- **Claude Code:** https://docs.anthropic.com/en/docs/claude-code
  - Anthropic's official CLI. Requires an Anthropic API key or Claude subscription.

- **Gemini CLI:** https://github.com/google-gemini/gemini-cli
