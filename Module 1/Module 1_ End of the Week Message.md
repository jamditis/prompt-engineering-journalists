# Module 1: Escaping the chat window

## End of the week message

You made it through Week 1.

This week you installed a command-line AI tool and compared it to web interfaces. The key insight: browser-based AI is convenient for quick questions, but the terminal gives you direct access to files and the ability to script repetitive tasks.

**What you learned:**
- How to install and authenticate a CLI tool (Claude Code, Gemini CLI, or Aider)
- The practical differences between web and terminal AI workflows
- Where CLI tools outperform chat windows: file processing, automation, and integration with existing tools

**Exercise reminder:** Your writeup comparing web vs. CLI workflows is due Sunday at 11:59pm. Submit a 300-500 word reflection covering your installation experience, workflow comparisons, and one journalism task you want to automate.

**Next week:** We move from running prompts to shaping how AI responds. Module 2 covers CLAUDE.md files and project memory. You'll learn to give AI persistent context about your project, your style preferences, and your newsroom's guidelines. No more explaining the same things in every conversation.

If you struggled this week, you're not alone. The command line has a learning curve. What matters is that you got a tool running and saw how it handles files differently than a chat window. That foundation carries through the rest of the course.

See you in Week 2.
