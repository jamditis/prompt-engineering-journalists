# Module 1: Escaping the chat window

## Discussion forum prompts

### Discussion 1: Your current AI workflow

**Prompt:**

Describe how you currently use AI in your journalism work. What tools do you use? What tasks do you use them for? What frustrates you about the process?

Then, identify one specific task from your workflow that might work better from the command line. Explain why you think so.

Reply to at least one classmate's post with a suggestion or question about their identified task.

### Discussion 2: Barriers to adoption

**Prompt:**

After reading about CLI tools and attempting the installation exercise, what concerns do you have about using terminal-based AI in a newsroom?

Consider:
- Technical barriers (installation, configuration, troubleshooting)
- Organizational barriers (IT policies, shared computers, training)
- Workflow barriers (speed, convenience, learning curve)

What would need to change for CLI tools to become practical for daily journalism work?

### Discussion 3: Use cases you want to explore

**Prompt:**

Based on the readings and your own experience, propose one journalism task you want to automate or improve using command-line AI tools.

Be specific:
- What is the task?
- How do you currently do it?
- What would the ideal CLI workflow look like?
- What obstacles might you encounter?

This will help shape topics for later modules, so think about what would be most useful to you.
