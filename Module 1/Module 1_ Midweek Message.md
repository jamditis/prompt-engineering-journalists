# Module 1: Escaping the chat window

## Midweek message

Hello everyone,

By now you should have completed the readings and started the hands-on exercise. If you have a CLI tool installed and running, you're on track.

A few things I'm seeing in the forums:

**Installation trouble.** Node.js version mismatches and PATH issues are common. If `node --version` shows nothing or an old version, reinstall from nodejs.org and restart your terminal. The Technical Help forum has solutions for specific error messages.

**"This is slower than the web interface."** That's normal for single prompts. The speed advantage comes when you process files or chain commands together. Stick with it through Part 4 of the exercise, where you process a local file. That's where the difference becomes clear.

**Which tool to choose?** If you're stuck deciding, go with Gemini CLI for its free tier or Claude Code if you already have a Claude subscription. You can always try another tool later.

Your discussion posts are due by Friday. I've read some good observations about workflow friction and newsroom adoption barriers. If you haven't posted yet, start with Discussion 1 (your current AI workflow) since it requires the least technical setup.

Keep going. The terminal will feel more natural by the end of the week.
