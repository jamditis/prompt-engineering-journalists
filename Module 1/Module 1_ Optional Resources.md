These are not required but may be useful depending on your interests and experience level.

### Further reading on Mollick's work

Ethan Mollick's framework (models / apps / harnesses) runs through this entire course. If the required readings sparked your interest, a curated list of his other articles is available in the course resources:

**Mollick reading list** — `Resources/mollick-reading-list.md`

Organized by theme: getting started, working methods, agents and automation, AI capabilities and limits, and education. Each entry includes a direct link and a brief description of why it's relevant to journalism work.
