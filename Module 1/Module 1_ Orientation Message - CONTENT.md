# Module 1: Escaping the chat window

## Orientation message

Welcome to Module 1 of Advanced Prompt Engineering for Journalists.

This week, we move beyond the browser. Most journalists interact with AI through web interfaces like ChatGPT or Claude.ai. These work fine for quick questions, but they limit what you can do. You cannot process files in bulk. You cannot integrate AI into your existing workflow. You cannot work with your local data without copying and pasting it into a chat box.

Terminal-based AI tools solve these problems. They run on your computer, access your files directly, and can be scripted to automate repetitive tasks.

By the end of this module, you will be able to:

1. **Install and configure at least one command-line AI tool** (Claude Code, Gemini CLI, Codex, or Aider)
2. **Execute basic AI prompts from your terminal** instead of a web browser
3. **Explain the practical differences** between browser-based and terminal-based AI workflows
4. **Identify three journalism tasks** that work better from the command line than a chat window

## What you will do this week

- Complete the required readings on CLI tool installation and use cases
- Work through the hands-on exercise comparing web vs terminal workflows
- Participate in the discussion forum
- Take the module quiz

## Getting started

Before anything else, make sure you have a terminal application on your computer:

- **Mac:** Terminal (built-in) or iTerm2
- **Windows:** Windows Terminal, PowerShell, or Git Bash
- **Linux:** Your default terminal emulator

If you have never used the terminal before, do not worry. The exercise walks you through each step.

Let's get started.
