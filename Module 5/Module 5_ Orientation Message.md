# Module 5: Agents and RAG

## Orientation message

Welcome to Week 5. This module covers two concepts that are changing how newsrooms work with AI: agents and retrieval-augmented generation (RAG).

Until now, we've focused on prompting AI models directly. But the most powerful applications in journalism connect AI to external data sources and give it the ability to take actions on your behalf.

This week, you'll learn how major news organizations are using these technologies right now, and you'll set up your own system to query a local knowledge base.

## Learning objectives

By the end of this module, you will be able to:

1. **Explain what AI agents are** and how they differ from standard chatbots, including their ability to use tools, make decisions, and complete multi-step tasks.

2. **Describe how RAG works** and why it matters for journalism, particularly for searching archives, fact-checking, and generating source-attributed content.

3. **Evaluate the tradeoffs** between AI autonomy and editorial control, identifying where human oversight is necessary in agent-based workflows.

4. **Configure a basic MCP server** to connect an AI assistant to a local knowledge base, demonstrating the practical mechanics of RAG.

## Key terms

**Agent**: An AI system that can use tools, make decisions, and complete tasks across multiple steps without continuous human input.

**RAG (Retrieval-Augmented Generation)**: A technique that retrieves relevant documents from a knowledge base and includes them in the AI's context before generating a response.

**MCP (Model Context Protocol)**: Anthropic's open standard for connecting AI models to external data sources and tools.

**Knowledge base**: A structured collection of documents, data, or information that an AI system can search and reference.

**Grounding**: The practice of connecting AI responses to specific source documents, reducing hallucination and enabling attribution.

## What's ahead

The readings introduce you to real newsroom implementations: The Washington Post's Haystacker for investigative research and The New York Times's Echo for content production. You'll also read about the Model Context Protocol and how RAG systems work.

The discussion forum asks you to think critically about where AI should and shouldn't operate autonomously in journalism.

The hands-on exercise walks you through setting up Claude Code with MCP to query markdown files, giving you direct experience with the technology.

Let's get started.
