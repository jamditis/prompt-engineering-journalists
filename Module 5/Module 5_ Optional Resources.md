## Academic papers

**"Retrieval-Augmented Generation for Knowledge-Intensive NLP Tasks"**
Lewis et al., 2020
https://arxiv.org/abs/2005.11401

The original RAG paper from Facebook AI Research. Technical but foundational. Read the abstract and introduction for the key concepts; the methods section is optional unless you want the full picture.

**"ReAct: Synergizing Reasoning and Acting in Language Models"**
Yao et al., 2023
https://arxiv.org/abs/2210.03629

Describes the ReAct pattern used in many AI agents: interleaving reasoning steps with tool use. Explains why agents that "think out loud" perform better on complex tasks.

**"Toolformer: Language Models Can Teach Themselves to Use Tools"**
Schick et al., 2023
https://arxiv.org/abs/2302.04761

How language models learn to call external APIs and tools. Useful background for understanding how agents decide when to retrieve information vs. generate from memory.

## Case studies and industry reports

**"AI in the newsroom: A survey of 100 news organizations"**
Reuters Institute, 2025
[Link to be added by instructor]

Survey data on how newsrooms are adopting AI tools, including agent-based systems. Good for benchmarking and understanding industry-wide patterns.

**"The Jay Rosen Digital Archive: AI enrichment and knowledge graphs"**
Project documentation (launching February 2026)
[Link to be added by instructor]

Your instructor's project applying entity extraction and RAG to a journalism archive. Shows how these techniques work with primary source materials.

**"Geneea: Building a RAG research assistant for newsrooms"**
Company whitepaper
[Link to be added by instructor]

Technical details on implementing RAG for news archives, including chunking strategies, embedding models, and retrieval optimization.

## Technical deep dives

**"Building effective agents"**
Anthropic cookbook
https://github.com/anthropics/anthropic-cookbook/tree/main/misc/building_effective_agents

Practical guide to agent architectures, including when to use simple prompts vs. multi-step agents.

**"MCP specification"**
Model Context Protocol documentation
https://spec.modelcontextprotocol.io/

The full technical specification. Reference material for the hands-on exercise and future projects.

**"Vector databases explained"**
Pinecone learning center
https://www.pinecone.io/learn/vector-database/

RAG systems use vector databases to find relevant documents. This explains how semantic search works under the hood.

## Podcasts and videos

**"How the Washington Post built Haystacker"**
[Podcast/video link to be added by instructor]

Interview with the engineering team behind the Post's investigative AI tool.

**"The future of AI agents in journalism"**
Online News Association conference, 2025
[Link to be added by instructor]

Panel discussion featuring editors from several newsrooms using agent-based tools.

## Tools to explore

**Claude Code**
https://claude.ai/code

The tool you'll use in this week's exercise. Free tier available.

**LangChain**
https://www.langchain.com/

Open-source framework for building RAG and agent applications. More complex than MCP but widely used.

**Ollama**
https://ollama.ai/

Run open-source language models locally. Useful if you want to experiment with RAG using free, local models.
