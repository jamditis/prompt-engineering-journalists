## Discussion 1: Drawing the line on AI autonomy

The Washington Post's Haystacker can analyze thousands of documents and surface patterns that humans might miss. The New York Times's Echo can draft newsletter content with minimal human input.

**Question:** Where should newsrooms draw the line between AI assistance and AI autonomy?

Consider these scenarios:
- An agent that automatically publishes breaking news alerts based on wire service feeds
- An agent that drafts follow-up questions during a live interview
- An agent that decides which stories to promote on the homepage based on engagement predictions

For each scenario (or others you imagine), explain:
1. What level of human oversight would you require?
2. What could go wrong if the AI operated without that oversight?
3. How would you explain the AI's role to your audience?

## Discussion 2: RAG and the problem of context

RAG systems retrieve relevant documents to ground AI responses in source material. But "relevant" is a judgment call.

**Question:** How should journalists think about what gets included in (and excluded from) a RAG knowledge base?

Consider:
- A knowledge base built from your newsroom's published articles excludes stories that were never written (gaps in coverage)
- A knowledge base of public records may contain errors or outdated information
- A knowledge base of interview transcripts captures what sources said, not necessarily what's true

In your response:
1. Describe a specific scenario where the contents of a knowledge base could bias the AI's output
2. What safeguards would you put in place?
3. How does this compare to the biases already present in traditional research methods?

## Discussion 3: The infrastructure question

Implementing agents and RAG requires technical infrastructure: servers, databases, APIs, and staff who can maintain them. Large organizations like the Post and Times can build custom tools. Smaller newsrooms cannot.

**Question:** What does this mean for the future of local and independent journalism?

In your response, address:
1. Should news organizations share AI infrastructure, and if so, how?
2. What role should vendors, foundations, or industry associations play?
3. What's the risk if only large newsrooms can afford these tools?

You might draw on your own newsroom's situation or experiences from earlier in the course.

## Discussion guidelines

- Ground your arguments in the readings, but bring in your own experience
- Disagree respectfully; explain why you see it differently
- Avoid generalizations like "AI will never..." or "AI will always..."
- Ask follow-up questions of your classmates

Posts are due by **[DATE]**. Responses are due by **[DATE]**.
