# Module 5: Agents and RAG

## End of the week message

You've completed the final module.

This week you learned how agents and RAG are changing what's possible in newsrooms. AI systems that can access knowledge bases and take multi-step actions are already at work in organizations like the Post and the Times. You now have hands-on experience configuring the same technology.

**What you learned:**
- What distinguishes agents from standard chatbots
- How RAG grounds AI responses in source documents
- The tradeoffs between AI autonomy and editorial control
- How to configure MCP to connect Claude Code to a local knowledge base

**Exercise reminder:** Your MCP submission (screenshot plus five reflection questions) is due Sunday at 11:59pm.

**What's next:** The final project applies everything from this course. You'll build a working tool for your newsroom: a skill, a pipeline, or a RAG-enabled assistant. Details are in the Final Project module.

The discussions this week raised hard questions about AI in journalism: autonomy, bias, infrastructure costs, and who gets left behind. There are no clean answers. What matters is that you're thinking about these questions now, while the technology is still taking shape.

Over five weeks you moved from browser-based prompting to building automated pipelines and configuring AI systems that query your own documents. That's a real skill set. Use it.

Thank you for your work this term.
