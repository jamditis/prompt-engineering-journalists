Welcome to "How to report safely: A guide for women journalists & their allies" organized by the Knight Center for Journalism in the Americas, in partnership with the International Women’s Media Foundation and UNESCO, with financial support from the Swedish Postcode Foundation.
I’m Alison Baskerville, the Lead Instructor and I’m looking forward to guiding you through this course. organized by the Knight Center for Journalism in the Americas, in partnership with the International Women’s Media Foundation and UNESCO, with financial support from the Swedish Postcode Foundation.
While safety risks are a concern to all journalists, women journalists face additional threats due to their gender. Research shows women and non-binary journalists more routinely experience sexual harassment, abuse and gender-based violence, both online and offline. These threats often intersect with other types of abuse such as racist, homophobic, transphobic or faith-based atttacks.
During this wide-reaching four-week course on safety, you will learn about how to prepare for threats online, in the field and in the newsroom, while working as a non-binary or woman journalist. You’ll also learn about the global context of violence and hear from journalists and operatives in the field who will share proven strategies to combat a range of abuse. Specific takeaways include -- through a gender-sensitive lens -- concrete and practical guidance on how to respond in varied scenarios.
Start by checking out the syllabus for the course, which lays out our goals and what we’ll go over each week. You can find it here. Then be sure to look at the introductory reading materials which set out to highlight the risks women journalists face along with the rising cases of sexual violence faced by women journalists as well as the need for better representation for women of colour in the global media community.
