# Module 3: Custom skills for Claude Code

## End of the week message

Week 3 is complete.

This week you learned how skills extend Claude Code's capabilities. Instead of explaining your methodology each time, you encode it once in a SKILL.md file and invoke it with a slash command.

**What you learned:**
- How skill files are structured and where they're stored
- How to install skills from a GitHub repository
- How to apply the source-verification skill to fact-check a claim
- When reusable skills save time versus when direct prompts work better

**Exercise reminder:** Your source-verification submission is due Sunday at 11:59pm. Include your SIFT process documentation, your findings on the coffee/cortisol claim, and one suggestion for improving the skill.

**Next week:** Module 4 covers CLI workflows. You'll learn to chain tools together using pipes, build shell scripts that automate content processing, and schedule tasks to run automatically. We'll build a pipeline that fetches articles, summarizes them with AI, and formats them for newsletters.

The discussion this week surfaced good ideas for newsroom-specific skills: beat-specific interview question generators, style guide checkers, and social media post formatters. Consider building one of these for your final project.

Skills are the bridge between knowing how to prompt and building tools your colleagues can use. The verification skill you used this week could be shared with your entire team tomorrow.

See you in Week 4.
