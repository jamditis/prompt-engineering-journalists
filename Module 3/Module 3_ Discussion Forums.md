## Discussion forum prompts

Participate in at least one discussion thread. Respond to at least two classmates.

### Discussion 1: What skills does your newsroom need?

After reviewing the journalism skills repository, think about your daily work.

**Prompt:**
What recurring tasks in your newsroom could become skills? Describe one specific workflow you repeat often—something that takes multiple steps and follows a consistent pattern. Explain what the skill would do and how it would save time.

**Examples to get you thinking:**
- Writing social media posts for different platforms from the same article
- Checking if sources have appeared in previous coverage
- Formatting data from specific government agencies
- Generating interview question lists for particular beat areas

**Response requirements:**
- Describe the task in enough detail that someone could start writing the skill
- Estimate how often you do this task (daily, weekly, monthly)
- Note any edge cases or variations the skill would need to handle

### Discussion 2: Customization vs. flexibility trade-offs

Skills encode specific methods and workflows. This is useful when you want consistency, but it means decisions are made in advance.

**Prompt:**
The source-verification skill uses the SIFT method. But what if you prefer a different verification approach? Or what if the skill's assumptions don't fit a particular story?

Discuss the trade-off between customized tools and flexible prompting. When is it better to have a skill that makes decisions for you? When is it better to work without a skill and give instructions each time?

**Consider:**
- Training and onboarding new staff
- Consistency across team members
- Unusual or edge-case situations
- Speed vs. control

### Discussion 2b: When the AI gets it wrong — do you capture it?

When an AI tool fails you — generates a wrong quote, ignores an instruction, takes the wrong approach — what do you do with that failure?

Most people correct the output and move on. The failure lives in the session, then disappears when the session ends. The next session can make the same mistake because nothing was written down.

Practitioners who work with these tools daily describe a different habit: capture the failure while it's fresh. The exact prompt that triggered it, what category of error it was, what the AI did instead, what you think caused it. That log feeds back into the CLAUDE.md as a rule that prevents the mistake next time.

**Prompt:** Do you have any existing system — in your reporting work or elsewhere — for capturing failures and turning them into process improvements? What would it look like to apply that same discipline to AI workflows? What would you need to log, and how often would you review it?

### Discussion 3: Sharing skills across newsrooms

Skills are just markdown files. They can be shared on GitHub, emailed to colleagues, or published openly.

**Prompt:**
What are the benefits and risks of sharing newsroom-specific skills publicly? Should skills that encode editorial workflows be kept private, or is there value in open-sourcing them for the journalism community?

**Consider:**
- Competitive advantage vs. collective benefit
- Security concerns (do skills reveal sensitive processes?)
- Maintaining and updating shared skills
- Building on each other's work

## Participation guidelines

- **Be specific.** General observations are less useful than concrete examples from your work.
- **Engage with classmates.** Don't just post your own response—respond to others with questions or alternative perspectives.
- **Keep it practical.** Focus on what would actually help in a newsroom setting.
