# Module 2: Prompting with files and project context

## End of the week message

You made it through Week 2.

This week you learned the feature that justifies switching from web chat to CLI tools: persistent project context. Instead of re-explaining your beat, your style, and your standards in every conversation, you write them once in a file and the tool follows them automatically.

**What you learned:**
- How context files work across tools (CLAUDE.md, GEMINI.md, AGENTS.md) and why they matter
- The deletion test for deciding what belongs in a context file
- How to process journalism documents directly from the filesystem
- The difference context makes — same documents, different results
- What Git repositories and commits are, and why your context files belong in version-controlled projects

**Exercise reminder:** Your comparison writeup and CLAUDE.md file are due Sunday at 11:59pm. Submit your before/after comparison (300-500 words) along with the context file you wrote.

**Next week:** Module 3 takes what you learned this week and makes it permanent. You wrote a CLAUDE.md file to give the AI project-level context. Next week, you'll learn to write *skills* — reusable slash commands that encode your journalism expertise into tools you can invoke on demand. You'll also clone a journalism skills library from GitHub — this is where the Git concepts from this week pay off. If writing a context file felt useful, skills are the next step: instead of the AI passively reading your instructions, you actively trigger specific workflows with commands like `/source-verification` or `/foia-request`.

The progression makes sense once you see it: first you used the tools (Module 1), then you taught the tools about your work (Module 2), and next you'll build custom tools on top of them (Module 3).

**Checklist:**
- [ ] Completed the hands-on exercise (before/after comparison)
- [ ] Posted in at least one discussion forum
- [ ] Responded to at least two classmates
- [ ] Completed the quiz

See you in Week 3.
