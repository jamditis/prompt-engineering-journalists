## Module 2: Voice-controlled AI

Hello everyone,

Week 2 is wrapping up. Thank you for your participation in the discussion forums. The conversations about when voice input helps (and when it doesn't) have been useful.

### Key takeaways

1. **Voice input is a tool, not a replacement for typing.** Use it when it makes sense: brainstorming, drafting, multitasking. Type when precision matters.

2. **Transcription accuracy varies.** Cloud services like Gemini Flash are often more accurate than local options, but local transcription protects sensitive audio.

3. **Raw mode vs. agent mode matters.** Raw mode transcribes exactly what you say. Agent mode interprets your speech as commands. Know which one you're using.

4. **Practice helps.** Voice input feels awkward at first. It gets easier.

### Looking ahead to Module 3

Next week we'll build on voice input by exploring multimodal prompting: using images, audio, and video with AI tools. If you struggled with voice transcription this week, don't worry. Module 3 doesn't require voice input.

### Before you move on

Make sure you've completed:

- [ ] The hands-on exercise (dictating a story outline)
- [ ] The discussion forum posts
- [ ] The quiz

If you're behind, you can catch up over the weekend. The materials will remain available.

Thank you for your work this week.

See you in Module 3.
