### Git fundamentals

**"Git will finally make sense after this"** — LearnThatStack
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ala6PHlYjmw

13-minute video explaining how Git works internally: commits as complete snapshots (not just diffs), branches as lightweight pointers, the three areas where code lives (working directory, staging area, repository), and when to use checkout vs reset vs revert vs rebase. Conceptual rather than command-by-command.

The Module 2 exercise has you directing your CLI tool to create repos, stage files, and commit. Watching this first means you can verify what the tool actually did — not just trust that it worked.

**"My CLAUDE.md"** by various developers (GitHub search)
https://github.com/search?q=filename%3ACLAUDE.md&type=code

Search GitHub for real CLAUDE.md files in public repositories. Seeing how other people structure their context files is one of the fastest ways to improve your own. Look for files from journalism or writing-focused projects.

### Context engineering in practice

**"Prompt engineering is dead, long live context engineering"** by Swyx
https://www.latent.space/p/context-engineering

An argument that the important skill isn't writing better prompts — it's giving the AI better context. Relevant framing for why CLAUDE.md files matter more than individual prompt tricks.

### Newsroom configuration examples

**Journalism skills repository** by Joe Amditis
https://github.com/jamditis/claude-skills-journalism

The instructor's skills repository includes example CLAUDE.md patterns designed for newsroom use. Look at the repository's own CLAUDE.md for an example of how a journalism-focused project structures its context file. This repository is covered in depth in Module 3.
