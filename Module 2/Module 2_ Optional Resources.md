### Advanced CLAUDE.md examples

**Claude Code best practices** by Anthropic
https://docs.anthropic.com/en/docs/claude-code/best-practices

Anthropic's own guide to getting the most out of Claude Code, including tips on writing effective CLAUDE.md files and structuring projects for AI-assisted work.

**"My CLAUDE.md"** by various developers (GitHub search)
https://github.com/search?q=filename%3ACLAUDE.md&type=code

Search GitHub for real CLAUDE.md files in public repositories. Seeing how other people structure their context files is one of the fastest ways to improve your own. Look for files from journalism or writing-focused projects.

### Context engineering in practice

**"Prompt engineering is dead, long live context engineering"** by Swyx
https://www.latent.space/p/context-engineering

An argument that the important skill isn't writing better prompts — it's giving the AI better context. Relevant framing for why CLAUDE.md files matter more than individual prompt tricks.

### Newsroom configuration examples

**Journalism skills repository** by Joe Amditis
https://github.com/jamditis/claude-skills-journalism

The instructor's skills repository includes example CLAUDE.md patterns designed for newsroom use. Look at the repository's own CLAUDE.md for an example of how a journalism-focused project structures its context file. This repository is covered in depth in Module 3.

### Cross-tool comparison

**Aider conventions file documentation**
https://aider.chat/docs/usage/conventions.html

Aider uses a `.aider.conventions.md` file for the same purpose as CLAUDE.md. This documentation explains how Aider loads and applies project-level instructions, showing yet another implementation of the same pattern.
