## Module 2: Voice-controlled AI

---

### Discussion question 1: When would you use voice instead of typing?

Think about your daily journalism work: researching, writing, editing, communicating with sources.

In which situations could voice input be faster or more convenient than typing? In which situations would it be worse?

Share at least one specific scenario where you think voice would help, and one where typing is clearly better. Explain your reasoning.

### Discussion question 2: Privacy concerns with voice transcription

Many voice transcription services send your audio to cloud servers for processing. For journalists, this raises questions about source protection and confidentiality.

How do you think about the tradeoff between convenience (cloud transcription is often more accurate) and privacy (local transcription keeps audio on your machine)?

Would your answer change depending on what you're transcribing? For example, a story outline vs. an interview with a confidential source?

### Discussion question 3: Voice input accessibility

Voice input was originally developed as an accessibility feature for people who cannot use a keyboard.

Have you used voice control or dictation features before this course? If so, in what context?

How might newsrooms better support journalists who rely on voice input due to disability or injury? What barriers exist?
