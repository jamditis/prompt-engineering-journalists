## Module 2: Prompting with files and project context

---

### Discussion question 1: What would you put in a context file for your beat?

Think about your current beat or area of coverage. If you were writing a CLAUDE.md file to configure an AI tool for your daily work, what would you include?

Share 3-5 specific instructions you would add. For each one, explain why it matters — what would go wrong if the AI didn't have that instruction?

Apply the deletion test: would a reporter who already covers your beat need these instructions, or are they things only an outsider would need to be told?

### Discussion question 2: Compare your results with and without context

In the exercise, you processed the same documents twice: once without a context file and once with it.

What changed? Pick one specific example where the with-context response was noticeably different from the without-context response. Describe the difference and explain which instruction in your context file caused it.

If you didn't see much difference, explain why you think that happened. Was the context file too generic? Were the prompts already specific enough that context didn't matter?

### Discussion question 3a: Keeping your CLAUDE.md honest

Practitioners who use CLI tools heavily report a consistent pattern: context files start lean and useful, then grow as the project develops, then get bloated enough to start hurting rather than helping.

What's your approach to keeping a context file sharp over time? Do you have a regular review process, or do you wait until you notice something going wrong? What would signal to you that a context file has become a liability instead of an asset?

If you've used a style guide or reporting checklists in your work before, how does the maintenance challenge compare?

### Discussion question 3: How could shared context files help a newsroom?

Context files are just text files. They can be shared, version-controlled with Git, and maintained by a team.

Imagine your newsroom created a shared CLAUDE.md that every reporter used. What would go in it? Who would maintain it? How would you handle disagreements about style or standards?

What are the risks of a shared context file? Could it introduce bias or constrain reporters in unhelpful ways?
