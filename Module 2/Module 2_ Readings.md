**"Voice and the uncanny valley of AI"** by Benedict Evans
https://www.ben-evans.com/benedictevans/2017/2/22/voice-and-the-uncanny-valley-of-ai

Evans examines why voice technology stalled for years and applies the "uncanny valley" concept to voice interfaces — improvements in technology can paradoxically create worse user experiences until a threshold is crossed. A useful framing for understanding why voice-to-terminal tools are only now becoming practical.
