# Introductory readings

## Before you begin: two things to read

Complete these before Module 1 starts. They aren't about tools or techniques — they're about understanding where AI in journalism is right now and why the shift from chat interfaces to programmatic tools matters. Everything else in this course will make more sense with this context.

### 1. A guide to which AI to use in the agentic era

**Author:** Ethan Mollick, Wharton School, University of Pennsylvania

**Time:** 20 minutes

Mollick argues that we're in a transition from AI as conversational tools to AI as agents that take actions on your behalf. He introduces a framework that runs through this entire course: **models** (the underlying intelligence), **apps** (the chat interfaces you've been using), and **harnesses** (CLI tools that let AI act on files and systems).

If you've been using ChatGPT or Claude.ai, you've been using apps. This course teaches you to use harnesses. Mollick explains why that difference matters and what becomes possible when you move from one to the other.

This is the conceptual foundation for everything that follows.

### 2. Journalism, media, and technology trends and predictions

*(Instructor: this URL is for the 2025 edition — verify and update each year.)*
**Time:** 30 minutes (read sections on AI; you don't need to read the full report)

The Reuters Institute surveys hundreds of news industry leaders each year on where media is heading. The AI sections document how newsrooms are actually using AI tools right now — what's working, what isn't, and what they're prioritizing. Read this alongside Mollick's framework to understand the gap between where most newsrooms are (apps) and where advanced practitioners are going (harnesses and automation).

Focus on the sections covering AI in content production, workflow automation, and editorial oversight. Skip the sections on subscriptions, advertising, and revenue models unless they interest you.

### 3. Claude Code and what comes next

**Author:** Ethan Mollick, Wharton School, University of Pennsylvania
**Source:** One Useful Thing (Substack)
**URL:** https://www.oneusefulthing.org/p/claude-code-and-what-comes-next
**Published:** January 7, 2026
**Time:** 15 minutes

Mollick describes what happened when he gave Claude Code open-ended tasks — not "write me a prompt" but "build me a working business plan, a startup concept, a game" — and watched it complete them with minimal direction. He's a professor, not a developer, and that's the point: CLI tools like Claude Code are now usable by people who can't code.

This piece shows what the harness layer actually looks like in practice. You'll understand it better after Module 1, but read it now to see where the course is headed.

## What to notice as you read

The 101 course taught you to use AI through chat interfaces — that's the app layer. Pay attention to moments in both readings where the authors describe limitations of that approach: context that evaporates, tasks that require copy-pasting, workflows that can't be automated. Those limitations are what Module 1 addresses.

By the end of Module 5, you'll be working at the harness layer. These readings explain why that matters.
