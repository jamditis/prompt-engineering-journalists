## Advanced prompt engineering for journalists

Welcome to Advanced Prompt Engineering for Journalists. I'm Joe Amditis, Associate Director of Operations at the Center for Cooperative Media at Montclair State University. I'll be your instructor for the next five weeks.

### About this course

This course picks up where Prompt Engineering 101 left off. In the 101 course, you learned to write effective prompts through web interfaces — ChatGPT, Claude.ai, Gemini. You got good at it. But you also hit the walls: uploading files one at a time, copying and pasting output, no way to process a folder of documents, and starting from scratch every session.

This course moves you past those walls. Each week builds on something you learned in the 101 course and extends it:

- Web prompting becomes terminal prompting — where AI is programmable, not just interactive
- Typing prompts becomes speaking prompts — using voice as a different way to think, not just a different way to type
- Writing good prompts becomes encoding them as reusable skills — write it once, use it forever
- No-code automation becomes scripted pipelines — with cost controls, checkpointing, and rate limiting
- Understanding AI concepts becomes building with agents and RAG — where source attribution survives the process

### About your instructor

I'm Joe Amditis. I've worked at the Center for Cooperative Media since 2015, where I focus on newsroom technology, AI tools, and helping journalists work more efficiently. I write about AI and journalism at my Substack, and I've led workshops on prompt engineering for news organizations across the country.

I use the tools we'll cover every day. Claude Code is part of my regular workflow for data analysis, document processing, and building internal tools. This isn't theoretical. It's practical knowledge from daily use.

### Prerequisites

This course assumes you have completed Prompt Engineering 101 for Journalists or have equivalent experience. You should be comfortable:

- Writing prompts for ChatGPT, Claude, or similar AI assistants
- Understanding basic AI concepts like context windows and temperature
- Getting useful results from chat-based AI interfaces

If you've never used AI tools before, start with Prompt Engineering 101.

You do not need programming experience. We'll teach you what you need to know about the terminal.

### How to succeed in this course

**Do the exercises.** Reading about terminal commands is not the same as running them. The hands-on exercises are where learning happens.

**Ask questions early.** If something doesn't work, post in the discussion forums. Don't spend hours stuck on an error message.

**Install the tools before you need them.** Module 1 involves installing software. Do this early in the week so you have time to troubleshoot.

**Participate in discussions.** You'll learn as much from other students as from the materials. Journalism workflows vary, and your colleagues will have different use cases and solutions.

**Set aside focused time.** Plan for 4-6 hours per week. Block time on your calendar rather than trying to squeeze this in between deadlines.

### What's next

Start by reading the syllabus and course requirements. Make sure your computer meets the technical requirements before Module 1 begins.

If you have questions about the course structure or logistics, post in the "Question for the instructor" forum.
