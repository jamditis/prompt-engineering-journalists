## Assignments and grading

### Participation (30%)

**Discussion forums:** Each module includes a discussion forum. Post at least one original contribution and respond to at least two classmates per module. Posts should be substantive (more than "I agree").

**Engagement:** Complete all required activities by the weekly deadline.

### Weekly exercises (50%)

Each module includes a hands-on exercise. Exercises are graded on completion and demonstrated understanding. You must show your work: screenshots, code snippets, or command output.

- Module 1: CLI tool installation and comparison (10%)
- Module 2: Voice dictation exercise (10%)
- Module 3: Custom skill creation (10%)
- Module 4: Workflow automation (10%)
- Module 5: RAG pipeline exercise (10%)

### Final project (20%)

Design and document a CLI-based AI workflow for a real journalism task. This can be for your own newsroom or a hypothetical scenario.

**Requirements:**
- Written description of the problem and solution (500-1000 words)
- Working code or configuration files
- Screenshots or video demonstrating the workflow
- Reflection on what you learned

**Due:** End of Module 5

## Course policies

### Late work

Weekly exercises can be submitted up to 48 hours late with a 10% penalty. After 48 hours, exercises receive no credit. The final project deadline is firm.

### Academic integrity

All submitted work must be your own. You may use AI tools to complete assignments (that's the point of this course), but you must document which tools you used and how. Copying another student's work is not permitted.

### Technical problems

If you encounter technical issues that prevent you from completing an assignment, contact the instructor before the deadline. We will work out a solution.

### Communication

Use the discussion forums for questions about course content. Other students likely have the same questions. Email the instructor for personal matters.

## Required tools

You will need access to the following (detailed in Course Requirements):

- A computer with terminal access (Mac, Windows, or Linux)
- Node.js version 20 or higher
- At least one AI API key or subscription
- A text editor (VS Code recommended)
- Git (optional but helpful)
