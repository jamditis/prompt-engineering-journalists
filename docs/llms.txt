# Advanced Prompt Engineering for Journalists

> A free 5-week online course from the Knight Center for Journalism in the Americas, taught by Joe Amditis. Moves journalists from chat-based AI to command-line coding assistants: Claude Code, Gemini CLI, and Codex.

## Course details

- Instructor: Joe Amditis, Center for Cooperative Media, Montclair State University
- Institution: Knight Center for Journalism in the Americas, UT Austin
- Format: Free online MOOC, 5 weeks
- Prerequisite: Prompt Engineering 101 for Journalists (or equivalent)
- URL: https://jamditis.github.io/prompt-engineering-journalists/

## Modules

- Module 1: Escaping the chat window — Programmatic AI control via terminal CLI tools
- Module 2: Prompting with files — Project context files (CLAUDE.md, GEMINI.md, AGENTS.md)
- Module 3: Custom skills — Turning domain expertise into reusable AI tools and hooks
- Module 4: CLI workflows — Unix philosophy, cost-conscious pipelines, batch processing
- Module 5: Agents and RAG — Grounded knowledge, source attribution, autonomous workflows

## Tools covered

- Claude Code (Anthropic) — npm install -g @anthropic-ai/claude-code
- Gemini CLI (Google) — npm install -g @google/gemini-cli
- Codex CLI (OpenAI) — npm install -g @openai/codex
- Aider — pip install aider-chat
- Context files: CLAUDE.md, GEMINI.md, AGENTS.md

## Key concept

"Vibe coding" is using AI coding assistants to build software by describing what you want in plain language. The AI writes the code; you guide the process through iterative prompting. This course teaches journalists how to move from basic chat prompting to building real tools with AI assistance.
