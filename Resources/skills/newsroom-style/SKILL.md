# Newsroom style skill

Enforces AP Style and newsroom conventions when writing or editing.

## When to use

Invoke this skill when:

- Writing news articles, briefs, or headlines
- Editing drafts for publication
- Converting informal notes into publishable copy

## Style rules

### Numbers
- Spell out one through nine; use numerals for 10 and above
- Always use numerals for ages, percentages, and addresses
- Spell out "percent" (not %)

### Titles
- Capitalize formal titles before names: Mayor Jane Smith
- Lowercase titles after names or standing alone: Jane Smith, the mayor
- Never use courtesy titles (Mr., Ms.) on second reference

### Attribution
- Use "said" for attribution (not stated, remarked, noted)
- Attribution goes after the quote, not before
- Place attribution at the first natural pause

### Dates and times
- Use month abbreviations: Jan., Feb., Aug., Sept., Oct., Nov., Dec.
- Don't abbreviate March, April, May, June, July
- Use figures for time: 9 a.m., 7:30 p.m. (not 9:00 a.m.)

### Common fixes
- "more than" for quantities (not "over")
- "fewer" for countable items, "less" for mass nouns
- "that" for restrictive clauses, "which" for nonrestrictive

## Format rules

- Paragraphs should be 1-3 sentences
- No exclamation points in hard news
- Headlines use sentence case, not title case

## Example

**Before:**
Yesterday Mayor John Smith said that he was "Very excited" about the new $5,000,000 project that will create over 100 jobs.

**After:**
Mayor John Smith said Tuesday he was "very excited" about the $5 million project, which will create more than 100 jobs.
