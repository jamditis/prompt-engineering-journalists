This is a reference example. Use it as a starting point, but write your own based on your beat.

## Beat

I cover Greenfield city government for the Greenfield Daily News. This includes the mayor's office, city council (7 members), city manager, and city departments (Parks & Rec, Public Works, Finance, Police, Fire).

Current officials:
- Mayor Diana Torres (D), elected November 2023, took office January 2024
- Council President: Margaret Walsh
- City Manager: Harold Briggs (appointed, not elected)

## Style

- AP style for all writing
- No Oxford comma
- "The city" on second reference (not "Greenfield" every time)
- Spell out numbers under 10
- Use "council member," not "councilman/councilwoman" unless the person prefers it
- Dollar amounts: $2.3 million, not $2,300,000

## Source standards

- Attribute all claims to named sources
- Flag unverified claims separately from verified ones
- If a source makes a factual claim (dates, dollar amounts, vote counts), note whether I can verify it independently
- Anonymous sources: note why they requested anonymity and what their position is relative to the story

## Terminology

- The annual budget process in Greenfield is called the "appropriations cycle"
- City council votes are called "resolutions" (binding) or "ordinances" (legislation) — don't use these interchangeably
- The Capital Improvement Program (CIP) is the multi-year infrastructure funding plan — don't call it "the capital budget"
- "Change orders" are modifications to a construction contract after it's been awarded

## Avoid

- Don't use "taxpayers" as a synonym for "residents" — not all residents pay property taxes
- Don't use "slammed," "blasted," or "fired back" to describe council disagreements — use "criticized," "questioned," or "pushed back on"
- Don't editorialize about whether spending is too high or too low — present the numbers and the arguments
- Don't use "according to sources" — always name the source or explain the anonymity
