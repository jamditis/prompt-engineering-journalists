## Mayor Torres announces temporary closure of Riverside Park for infrastructure improvements

**GREENFIELD** — Mayor Diana Torres today announced that Riverside Park will be temporarily closed beginning April 1 for critical infrastructure improvements. The closure is expected to last approximately four months.

"Riverside Park is one of Greenfield's greatest assets, and this investment ensures it will serve our community for decades to come," said Mayor Torres. "I know the temporary closure is an inconvenience, but the alternative — letting the infrastructure deteriorate further — would cost taxpayers far more in the long run."

The $2.3 million project will address aging water and drainage systems, replace the playground equipment that was installed in 2004, resurface the walking trails, and upgrade the lighting throughout the park. The project is funded through the city's Capital Improvement Program, which was approved by the City Council in January.

City Engineer Robert Huang said the park's drainage system has exceeded its useful life. "We've been patching the drainage for the last three years," Huang said. "A full replacement now prevents a much more expensive emergency repair later."

The closure will affect the park's walking trails, playground, sports fields, and picnic areas. The Riverside Community Center, which is located adjacent to the park, will remain open during construction.

The city has arranged for additional programming at Lincoln Park and Memorial Field to offset the closure. Youth sports leagues will be relocated to Memorial Field for the spring and summer seasons.

Construction will be performed by Meridian Infrastructure LLC, which was selected through the city's competitive bidding process. The project is expected to be completed by August 1, weather permitting.
