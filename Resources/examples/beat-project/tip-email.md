Hi,

I saw your article about the Riverside Park closure. I wanted to let you know that the contractor they picked, Meridian Infrastructure, is owned by Tom Kerrigan. Tom Kerrigan's brother-in-law is James Whitfield, who works in the city's procurement office.

I'm not saying anything improper happened but it seems like something people should know about, especially since the bid was for $2.3 million of taxpayer money. The competitive bidding process should be truly competitive.

I live in the Riverside neighborhood and I've been going to council meetings about this. At the March 10 meeting nobody mentioned this connection.

I tried looking up the bidding documents on the city's website but the procurement page just says "awarded to Meridian Infrastructure LLC" without showing the other bids or the scoring criteria.

Thank you for covering this. The park is important to our neighborhood and we want to make sure the project is handled properly.
