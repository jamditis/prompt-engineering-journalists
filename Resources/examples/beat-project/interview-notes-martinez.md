## Notes (paraphrased, not direct quotes unless in quotation marks)

Martinez said he was watching the Riverside Park situation closely. He said the $2.3 million price tag "sounds about right" for the scope of work described, but cautioned that the city has a history of underestimating infrastructure costs.

On the library comparison: Martinez said Petrov's concerns are valid. He was on the council during the library renovation and said the 40% cost overrun was partly due to the unexpected structural issues Briggs mentioned, but also partly due to change orders that were approved without full council review. "The structural stuff was genuinely unforeseen. But about $200K of that overrun was scope creep — additions that got approved by the city manager without coming back to us."

Martinez said he thinks the current council should require that any change orders over $50,000 come back to the full council for approval. He said this was proposed in 2020 but never voted on.

On the contractor: Martinez said Meridian did good work on Memorial Field. "No complaints on the quality. But I'd want to know if they've done drainage work at this scale before. Playground equipment and trail resurfacing are different from underground infrastructure."

Martinez said he's heard from neighborhood residents that some are worried the park closure is a precursor to selling part of the land for development. He called this "completely unfounded as far as I know" but said the mayor's office hasn't done enough to communicate the project timeline to residents.

He mentioned that the original drainage system was installed in 1987 and was supposed to last 30 years. "So it's actually past due. The question isn't whether to fix it but whether $2.3 million is the right number."

Martinez declined to comment on whether he plans to run for council again.

## My observations

- Martinez is being careful not to criticize the current council directly but is clearly signaling concerns
- The change order issue is worth following up — check if any policy was adopted after 2020
- The development rumor is new to me — worth asking the mayor's office about directly
- Need to verify the 1987 installation date for the drainage system independently
