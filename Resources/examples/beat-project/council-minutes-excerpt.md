## Agenda item 7: FY2026 budget discussion — Parks and Recreation

Council President Walsh opened discussion on the Parks and Recreation budget allocation for FY2026.

**Parks Director Lisa Nakamura** presented the department's budget request of $4.8 million, an increase of $600,000 over the current fiscal year. She said the increase was driven by the Riverside Park infrastructure project ($2.3 million) and rising maintenance costs across the city's 12 parks.

**Council Member Okafor** asked whether the Riverside Park project could be phased over two fiscal years to reduce the budget impact. Nakamura said phasing was considered but rejected because the drainage system needs full replacement — a partial fix would cost nearly as much and leave the park closed longer.

**Council Member Rivera** said he had received "dozens of calls" from residents in the Riverside neighborhood concerned about the closure. He asked whether the city had explored keeping portions of the park open during construction. Nakamura said the contractor determined that safety requirements made partial access impractical.

**Council Member Kim** asked about the contractor selection process. City Manager Harold Briggs said Meridian Infrastructure was the lowest qualified bidder at $2.3 million. The next lowest bid was $2.7 million from Apex Construction. Kim asked whether Meridian had performed work for the city before. Briggs said they completed the Memorial Field renovation in 2022 on time and under budget.

**Council Member Petrov** raised concerns about cost overruns. He cited the 2019 library renovation, which exceeded its budget by 40%. Briggs said the library project involved unexpected structural issues discovered during demolition, which he called "not comparable" to the park project. Petrov said he remained concerned and asked for quarterly progress reports.

**Council Member Goldstein** asked about the impact on the summer youth programs. Nakamura said all youth sports leagues would be relocated to Memorial Field and Lincoln Park. She said the department had already coordinated with league organizers. Goldstein asked whether Memorial Field had enough capacity. Nakamura said it would require "some scheduling adjustments" but was workable.

**Council Member Nash** said she supported the project but wanted to know whether any of the funding could come from state grants. Briggs said the city applied for a state infrastructure grant in December but had not received a response. He said the project would proceed regardless because the drainage system "cannot wait another year."

No vote was taken. The item will be on the agenda for the March 24 meeting.
