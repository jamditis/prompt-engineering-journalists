Duration: 12 minutes (excerpt below)

INTERVIEWER: How has local journalism changed in the past five years?

MITCHELL: The biggest shift is resources. We went from a staff of eight to three. So we cover fewer meetings, fewer beats. We focus on what matters most to readers.

INTERVIEWER: What does "what matters most" mean in practice?

MITCHELL: Schools, property taxes, and development. Those are the three things people email us about. Everything else is secondary.

INTERVIEWER: How do you decide what gets coverage when you're understaffed?

MITCHELL: We ask: Does this affect people's daily lives? A zoning change that could bring 200 new units downtown—that gets covered. A ceremonial proclamation—that doesn't.

INTERVIEWER: Some people say AI tools could help small newsrooms. What's your take?

MITCHELL: I'm cautiously interested. We've tried using it for first drafts of meeting summaries. Saves time, but you still need someone who was there to check accuracy.

INTERVIEWER: What's worked and what hasn't?

MITCHELL: Transcription works well. We record interviews and get usable text in minutes instead of hours. What doesn't work is letting it write the story. It makes things up or misses what's important.

INTERVIEWER: Final question—what would you tell journalism students today?

MITCHELL: Learn to do more with less. And never trust a quote you didn't hear yourself.
