        <p>The Riverside City Council voted 5-2 Tuesday night to approve zoning changes that will allow mixed-use development in the downtown corridor.</p>

        <p>The changes, which take effect in 60 days, will permit residential units above commercial spaces on Main Street between Oak Avenue and Pine Boulevard.</p>

        <h2>What the changes mean</h2>

        <p>Property owners in the affected area can now apply for permits to add up to three residential floors above existing retail spaces. The council also reduced parking requirements for new residential units from two spaces per unit to one.</p>

        <p>Council member Maria Torres, who sponsored the measure, said the changes address the city's housing shortage.</p>

        <p>"We have empty storefronts and people who need places to live," Torres said. "This gives property owners a path forward."</p>

        <h2>Opposition concerns</h2>

        <p>Council members David Park and Susan Chen voted against the measure, citing traffic and infrastructure concerns.</p>

        <p>Park said the city's water system may not handle the additional load without upgrades.</p>

        <p>The next step is a 30-day public comment period before implementation begins.</p>
