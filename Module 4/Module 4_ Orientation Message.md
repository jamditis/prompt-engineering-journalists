# Module 4: CLI workflows for newsrooms

## Orientation message

Hello, and welcome to Module 4.

This week we learn to chain AI tools with other command-line utilities. By the end of the week, you'll be able to build automated pipelines that fetch content, process it with AI, and output formatted results—all without clicking through browser tabs.

The command line isn't just for programmers. Journalists who work with data, scrape websites, or process documents regularly can save hours by automating repetitive tasks. A pipeline that clips an article, summarizes it with Claude, and formats it for your newsletter takes seconds to run once you've built it.

### Learning objectives

By the end of this module, you will be able to:

1. **Use piping to connect tools.** Chain the output of one command into another using the pipe operator (`|`).

2. **Build AI-powered shell pipelines.** Combine utilities like `curl`, `jq`, and Claude's CLI to automate content processing.

3. **Write reusable shell scripts.** Package your pipelines into scripts you can run repeatedly.

4. **Schedule automated tasks.** Use cron jobs to run pipelines on a schedule (e.g., daily news digests, weekly data pulls).

### This week's activities

- **Videos:** Watch the two video lectures on CLI basics and building pipelines
- **Readings:** Complete the required readings on shell fundamentals and automation patterns
- **Exercise:** Build a working "clip article → summarize → format" pipeline
- **Discussion:** Share your newsroom automation ideas in the forum
- **Quiz:** Complete the 5-question quiz on CLI concepts

### A note on getting stuck

The command line will feel unfamiliar if you haven't used it before. That's normal. The exercise this week walks you through each step. If you get stuck:

1. Read the error message carefully—it usually tells you what went wrong
2. Check that you've installed the required tools
3. Post in the "Technical help" forum with your error message and what you tried

Please complete all activities before the end of the week.

Best,
