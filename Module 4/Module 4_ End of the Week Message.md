# Module 4: CLI workflows for newsrooms

## End of the week message

You finished the toughest technical week of the course.

This week you built a working pipeline: fetch article, extract content, summarize with AI, format for output. That's the pattern behind most automation in newsrooms. Once you can chain these steps, you can adapt them to almost any repetitive task.

**What you learned:**
- How to use pipes to connect command-line tools
- How to call the Claude API directly from bash
- How to wrap a workflow in a reusable shell script
- How to schedule automated tasks with cron

**Exercise reminder:** Your pipeline submission is due Sunday at 11:59pm. Post a screenshot of your working script, one newsletter item it generated, and one idea for adapting the pipeline to your newsroom.

**Next week:** Module 5 covers agents and RAG. You'll learn how AI systems that can take actions and access external knowledge bases are changing newsroom workflows. We'll look at real implementations (The Washington Post's Haystacker, The New York Times's Echo) and you'll configure Claude Code to query a local knowledge base using MCP.

If you struggled this week, that's expected. Shell scripting and API calls are unfamiliar territory for most journalists. The important thing is you saw the pattern: input, process, output. Everything else is debugging.

The skills from this week (and Week 3) feed directly into the final project, where you'll build a tool for your own newsroom.

See you in Week 5.
